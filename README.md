# BalancedCodesKnuth

This project is an inplementation of Knuth's algorithm for balanced codes, given in "Efficient Balanced Codes", IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. 32,
no. 1, pp. 51â€“53, Jan. 1986. 

Our implementation supports various input lengths and alphabet size of upto 10 symbols.
We also added some improvements for the algorithm, making it better for various cases.

A documented details can be seen in *description.pdf* file.
## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

This project requires Python 3 for running it. It does not use any special libraries.

### Installing

Install python3 and download the git repository. 
After downloading, you can import from "knuth.py" and use the functions: encode_knuth, decode_knuth.

```
from knuth import *

to_encode = "001000110"

encoded = encode_knuth("001000110", 3) # encode into a 3-base balanced code
print(encoded)

decoded = decode_knuth(encoded, 3, 9) #decode for a vector of length 9
print(decoded)
```

The output suould be:
```
001000110112111221220222002
001000110
```

## Running the tests

The tests for this project can be found in *test.py* file.
Simply run the file and watch the test run. If a test fail you will be notified by the output.
### Some Important tests

#### test_encode_knuth
This test checks some basic vectors and see that they are encoded correctly.

#### test_decode_knuth
This test checks that vectors are decoded correctly by the decoding function

#### test_stress
This test generated random vectors and checks that they are encoded correctly and also decoded correctly. Additionally, there is a check that assures that the result of the encoding is balanced.
