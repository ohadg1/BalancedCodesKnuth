# BalancedCodesKnuth

This project is an inplementation of Knuth's algorithm for balanced codes, given in "Efficient Balanced Codes", IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. 32,
no. 1, pp. 51â€“53, Jan. 1986. 

Our implementation supports various input lengths and alphabet size of upto 10 symbols.
We also added some improvements for the algorithm, making it better for various cases.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

This project requires Python 3 for running it. It does not use any special libraries.

### Installing

Install python3 and download the git repository. 
After downloading, you can import from "knuth.py" and use the functions: encode_knuth, decode_knuth

```
from knuth import *

to_encode = "001000110"

encoded = encode_knuth("001000110", 3) # encode into a 3-base balanced code
print(encoded)

decoded = decode_knuth(encoded, 3, 9) #decode for a vector of length 9
print(decoded)
```

The output suould be:
```
221200110110000221111002222
001000110
```
